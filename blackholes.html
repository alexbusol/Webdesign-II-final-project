        <p>Finally, we have perhaps the most exotic and mysterious object in the universe: a Black Hole. Black Holes are the remnants of very massive stars. When such stars run out of their nuclear fuel, the fusion reaction in their core stops. Previously, the energy generated in the core provided pressure that was able to keep the enourmous mass of the star from collapsing on itself. However, since the fusion has stopped, the star collapses, generating a huge explosion called the supernova. Because of its high mass, there's no natural force left that is able to keep the star from collapsing further and further. Ultimately, the star collapses to an infinitely small point. The gravity of such point is so strong that nothing, not even light, which is the fastest moving thing in the universe, is able to escape from that region. Such region of space is called a black hole.
        <br>
        Since the black hole doesn't give off light, it is impossible to directly see it. It is possible, however, to see objects that interract with the black hole.
